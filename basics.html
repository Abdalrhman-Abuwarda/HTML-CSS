    <h1>This is the main heading</h1>

    <p lang="en-us">This text might be an introduction to the rest of
        the page. And if the page is a long one it might
        be split up into several sub-headings.</p>

    <h2>This is a Sub-heading</h2>

    <p>Many long articles have sub-headings so to help
        you follow the structure of what is being written.
        There may even be sub-sub-headings (or lower-level
        headings).</p>

    <h2>Another Sub-Heading</h2>
    <p>Here you can see another sub-heading.</p>

    <p>A paragraph consists of one or more sentences
        that form a self-contained unit of discourse. The
        start of a paragraph is indicated by a new
        line.</p>
    <p>Text is easier to understand when it is split up
        into units of text. For example, a book may have
        chapters. Chapters can have subheadings. Under
        each heading there will be one or more
        paragraphs.</p>

    <h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about
        an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies
        of <i>Nature</i>, <i>New Scientist</i>, and all
        the other scientific journals her work had
        appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite>On
            The Road</cite>. It had been Molly's favorite book
        since college, and the longer she spent in these
        four walls the more she felt she needed to be
        free.</p>
    <p>She had spent the last ten years in this room,
        sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote
        proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of
            people who have nothing better to do</q>. Although
        many considered her pioneering work, unraveling
        the secrets of the llama <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an
        outstanding achievement, Molly <em>did</em> think
        she had something better to do.</p>
